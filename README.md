# creative-coding-lab

A repository for shared creative coding experiments, adventures, challenges.

## structure

Having some structure in this repo benefits everyone working together. For the moment I propose that **every person using this shared creative coding repo, creates their own user folder** for their projects.

That way, contents may be copied and adjusted without breaking the original authors code unintentionally.

For shared projects, we can find another appropriate structuring scheme.

### filesystem naming conventions

User Folders: `u_<username>/`

### git & commits

Conventional commits with concise, descriptive messages are a way to make commit messages more easily readable. No strong enforcement, but appreciated.
